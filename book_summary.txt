Daron Acemoglu and Jim Robinson’s Why Nations Fail is published by Allen & Unwin .
The authors show that countries escape poverty only when they have appropriate economic institutions, especially private property and competition .
They argue that countries are more likely to develop the right institutions with an open pluralistic political system with competition for political office, a widespread electorate, and openness to new political leaders .
Francis Fukuyama, author of The End of History and the Last Man and The Origins of Political Order, calls it a “brilliant and uplifting book—yet also a deeply disturbing wake-up call’
Ian Morris, Stanford University, calls the book “a delightfully readable romp through four hundred years of history .
Two of the giants of contemporary social science bring us an inspiring and important message: it is freedom .
